# Webscraping IMDB list

This is just a simple script to pull data of Disney movies between 2021 and 2022
from a pre-created list on IMDB.  

The initial code just pulled a list of movies from a user created list. 
This was not adequate for the analysis I want to conduct. So I found a 
prebuilt list from the link below. 

https://www.finder.com/disney-plus-movie-tv-release-schedule 

At the time of writing this script the dataset was missing full release dates
But, having additional information about the films could have a positive
impact on my analysis. To add more data a new script is born. This script
searches each title based from the list provided by Finder. I can now search
through each movie and extract more information.
